This is an AutoHotkey script that enables you to record keyboard and mouse macros. This is based on the work of feiyue. See the original [here](https://www.autohotkey.com/boards/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=34184&sid=03fb579fcaef3c186e5568b72390ef9e)

See [Releases](https://github.com/raeleus/AHK-Macro-Recorder/releases) for the latest download.

I recorded a [tutorial video](https://youtu.be/9_l0rIXO9cU) on the script.

The documentation is the video, so make sure to watch it.

[Install AutoHotkey v2](https://www.autohotkey.com/).
